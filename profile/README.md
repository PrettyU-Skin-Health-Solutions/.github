PrettyU! : Empowering Personalized Skin Health Solutions

# **Project Background** 

In this modern era, the health and beauty of facial skin is an important concern for many people. Facial skin problems are often frustrating due to the lack of proper knowledge and information in choosing the right products. This app solves this problem by utilizing machine learning and image processing technology. Users can take a selfie of themselves, and the app will analyze the image to detect their skin type. 

The development of the app is based on extensive research in machine learning, image processing, dermatology and mobile app development. The team behind the app is motivated to provide a valuable solution for people in choosing cosmetic/skincare products that suit their skin type and needs. The app is expected to help users to achieve healthy and beautiful facial skin with appropriate information.

The project spanned across three primary learning paths: Machine Learning, Mobile Development, and Cloud Computing.
1. Machine Learning
We built predictive models using TensorFlow and TensorFlow.js to analyze facial images and detect skin types. Preprocessing techniques, such as cleaning the dataset from noisy images and augmenting the dataset, were used to ensure data quality. The models were trained to recognize various skin types accurately.
2. Mobile Development
We are responsible for creating the mobile application. Our responsibilities are included but not limited to: integrate both machine learning model and cloud computing inside the mobile apps, making sure that our applications are well optimized, and communicating with machine learning and cloud computing cohorts about the requirements needed for our application.
3. Cloud Computing
For the completeness of this application, we created APIs for application needs such as user login, register, and machine learning. We also integrated machine learning models and mobile app inputs by creating endpoints. Apart from that, Cloud Team provides Google Cloud infrastructure from preparing database, store models, then deployment.
